## Tang Yifeng (Boyan)

Who am I? 

I am currently a second grade Master student in the School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and I will graduate in Jul, 2023. My major is control science and engineering. The current research project is robot immitation learning and planning based on machine learning. 

I graduated from the College of automation, Chongqing University, majoring in automation which is also the so-called control science and engineering. Since I entered the University, I have been committed to learning and researching robot technology. The strong interest and passion drive me to explore and think. After a long period of hard work, I learned include mechanical design, circuit design, software design, control system design and machine learning algorithm. Among them, I am most familiar with software design and control system design. I have my own understanding of optimal control and nonlinear control, and I am trying to combine the traditional control algorithm with machine learning algorithm to develop an efficient robot system.

In my opinion, in order to design an excellent robot system, we must have a deep understanding of mathematical equations and engineering skills. As a result, I am now tring to use Reinforcement Learning, Meta Learning and Differential Game to develpment robot collabration system and learning system. At present, I am writing and summarizing my work , and I intend to submit the results to some high-level SCI journals, hoping to publish my research work.

### Undergraduate

I entered Chongqing University in 2015. In the first year of my unversity life, I spent a lot of time studying courses. At the end of this year, I worked with senior students to design a motorcycle damping system and applied for a patent with this system. Because of the good practical ability and excellent GPA, I got the opportunity to join the robot team of Chongqing University which is a famous student team that is active in many national robot competitions.

The left figure shows the motorcycle damping system, and the right figure shows the robots of robomaster in 2017. Then in the August of 2017, I followed my team and competited with 32 top teams from all over the world and finally won a National Third Prize. The following picture is the certificate of this Prize.

In the following year, I was elected captain and led the team to participate in the 2017-2018 season. Finally, we also won the third national prize. In this year, I was mainly responsible for the mechanism and circuit design of the robot below, and the software system of the whole team was constructed by me. The hardware platform is the PCB circuit board I designed as shown in the right figure above, and the software is STM32 program written in C programming language.
