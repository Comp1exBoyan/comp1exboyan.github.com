Who am I? 

I am currently a second grade Master student in the School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and I will graduate in Jul, 2023. My major is control science and engineering. The current research project is robot immitation learning and robot learning from demonstration. 

I graduated from the College of automation, Chongqing University, majoring in automation which is also the so-called control science and engineering. Since I entered the University, I have been committed to learning and researching robot technology. The strong interest and passion drive me to explore and think. After a long period of hard work, I learned include mechanical design, circuit design, software design, control system design and machine learning algorithm. Among them, I am most familiar with software design and control system design. I have my own understanding of optimal control and nonlinear control, and I am trying to combine the traditional control algorithm with machine learning algorithm to develop an efficient robot system.

In my opinion, in order to design an excellent robot system, we must have a deep understanding of mathematical equations and engineering skills. As a result, I am now tring to use Reinforcement Learning, Meta Learning and Differential Game to develpment robot collabration system and learning system. At present, I am writing and summarizing my work , and I intend to submit the results to some high-level SCI journals, hoping to publish my research work.

### Undergraduate

I entered Chongqing University in 2015. In the first year of my unversity life, I spent a lot of time studying courses. At the end of this year, I worked with senior students to design a motorcycle damping system and applied for a patent with this system. Because of the good practical ability and excellent GPA, I got the opportunity to join the robot team of Chongqing University which is a famous student team active in many national robot competitions.

The left figure shows the motorcycle damping system, and the right figure shows the robots of Robomaster in 2017. Then in the August of 2017, I fought with my team and competited with 32 top teams from all over the world and finally won a National Third Prize. The following picture is the certificate of this Prize.

In the following year, I was elected captain and led the team to compete with many other team in the 2017-2018 season.  In this season, our team which consists of 15-20 key members made 7 robots and battled with other teams and finally won the third national prize again. As a engineer, I participate in the designing and machining 3 of these robots. The left figure is a typical example of our robots. I participated in designing the mechanical structure of its chassis and the hardware circuit. The right figure shown the stm32 PCB control board designed for this robot.

During the two years as a Robomaster player, I learned and practiced mechanical design, hardware design, embedeed system developing and digital image processing etc.

In the next few years of my college life, I participated in a national undergraduate innovation and entrepreneurship project and won the national first prize. There !
was also a National Undergraduate Electronic Design Competition, which won the second prize of Chongqing. The graduation project was completed in the enterprise. In !

one year, the design of four PCB products was completed, and the college life was over. The following figure shows several circuit boards completed in the enterprise.
Due to my excellent performance and outstanding practical ability, I finally got the opportunity to be escorted to the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to study for a master's degree.

In the first year of my postgraduate career, I was arraned to finish courses in Beijing, so I did push forward my research. After returning to Shenzhen, in the first 3 months I participated in an automatic driving task. It mainly completes the design and development of trajectory tracking control system. As a classical robor control platform, Robot Operating system (ROS) is used in this program, and the development language is c++. In the following half a year, my research interest turned to the robot manipulation and learning form demonstration. At first, the development of an assembly project is completed, and yolov5 and detectron are used to identify and segment objects. And then for a long time, I studied the robot using reinforcement learning algorithm to learn how to hit ice hockey.



The paper that I am writing is based on this work. My main consideration is the sparse reward problem faced by the actual robot system. The method I currently choose is to improve the reinforcement learning algorithm itself, or introduce the curiosity mechanism to accelerate the robot learning process.

I hope to continue my research in the field of robotics during my PhD. I have a passion for robots, which drives me to study, think and overcome difficulties. I hope to study works that are useful and artistic to human society. In my opinion, engineering is also a kind of art, which can also bring people the feeling of beauty.
